    "## 2. Grouping Users together!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will deal with clustering algorithms that will provide groups of Netflix users that are similar among them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this task, you must accomplish the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Getting your data + feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Access to the data found in [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vodclickstream/netflix-audience-behaviour-uk-movies)\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Sometimes, the features (variables, fields) are not given in a dataset but can be created from it; this is known as *feature engineering*. For example, the original dataset has several clicks done by the same user, so grouping data by user_id will allow you to create new features **for each** user:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a)  Favorite genre (i.e., the genre on which the user spent the most time)\n",
    "\n",
    "    b)  Average click duration\n",
    "\n",
    "    c)  Time of the day (Morning/Afternoon/Night) when the user spends the most time on the platform (the time spent is tracked through the duration of the clicks)\n",
    "\n",
    "    d)  Is the user an old movie lover, or is he into more recent stuff (content released after 2010)?\n",
    "\n",
    "    e)  Average time spent a day by the user (considering only the days he logs in)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the end, you should have for each user_id five features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  Consider at least 10 additional features that can be generated for each user_id (you can use chatGPT or other LLM tools for suggesting features to create). Describe each of them and add them to the previous dataset you made (the one with five features). In the end, you should have for each user at least 15 features (5 recommended + 10 suggested by you).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Choose your features (variables)!\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice that you have plenty of features to work with now. So, it would be best to find a way to reduce the dimensionality (reduce the number of variables to work with). You can follow the subsequent directions to achieve it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  *To normalise or not to normalise? That's the question*. Sometimes, it is worth normalizing (scaling) the features. Explain if it is a good idea to perform any normalization method. If you think the normalization should be used, apply it to your data (look at the available normalization functions in the `scikit-learn` library).\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Select **one** method for dimensionality reduction and apply it to your data. Some suggestions are Principal Component Analysis, Multiple Correspondence Analysis, Singular Value Decomposition, Factor Analysis for Mixed Data, Two-Steps clustering. Make sure that the method you choose applies to the features you have or modify your data to be able to use it. Explain why you chose that method and the limitations it may have.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Clustering!\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Implement the K-means clustering algorithm (**not** ++: random initialization) using MapReduce. We ask you to write the algorithm from scratch following what you learned in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Find an optimal number of clusters. Use at least two different methods. If your algorithms provide diverse optimal K's, select one of them and explain why you chose it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  Run the algorithm on the data obtained from the dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)  Implement **K-means++** from scratch and explain the differences with the results you got earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "5)  Ask ChatGPT to recommend other clustering algorithms and choose one. Explain your choice, then ask ChatGPT to implement it or use already implemented versions (e.g., the one provided in the scikit-learn library) and run it on your data. Explain the differences (if there are any) in the results. Which one is the best, in your opinion, and why?\n",
    "   \n",
    "### 2.4 Analysing your results! --\n",
    "\n",
    "You are often encouraged to explain the main characteristics that your clusters have. The latter is called the *Characterizing Clusters* step. Thus, follow the next steps to do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  Select 2-3 variables you think are relevant to identify the cluster of the customer. For example, Time_Day, Average Click Duration, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  Most of your selected variables will be numerical (continuous or discrete), then categorize them into four categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)  With the selected variables, perform pivot tables. On the horizontal axis, you will have the clusters, and on the vertical axis, you will have the categories of each variable. Notice that you have to do one pivot table per variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4)  Calculate the percentage by column for each pivot table. The sum of each row (cluster) must be 100. The sample example for clustering with K = 4 and Time_Day variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/ericrubia99/ADM-HW5/blob/main/Pivot.png\" width = 308>\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5)  Interpret the results for each pivot table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6)  Use any known metrics to estimate clustering algorithm performance (how good are the clusters you found?). Comment on the results obtained."
