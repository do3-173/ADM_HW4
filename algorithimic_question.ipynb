    "## 5. Algorithmic Question \n",
    "\n",
    "Federico studies in a demanding university where he has to take a certain number $N$ of exams to graduate,  but he is free to choose in which order he will take these exams. Federico is panicking since this university is not only one of the toughest in the world but also one of the weirdest. His final grade won't depend at all on the mark he gets in these courses: there's a precise evaluation system. \n",
    "\n",
    "He was given an initial personal score of $S$ when he enrolled, which changes every time he takes an exam: now comes the crazy part.\n",
    "He soon discovered that every of the $N$ exams he has to take is assigned a mark $p$. Once he has chosen an exam, his score becomes equal to the mark $p$, and at the same time, the scoring system changes:\n",
    "+ If he takes an \"easy\" exam (the score of the exam being less than his score), every other exam's mark is increased by the quantity $S - p$.\n",
    "+ If he takes a \"hard\" exam (the score of the exam is greater than his score), every other exam's mark is decreased by the quantity $p - S$.\n",
    "  \n",
    "So, for example, consider $S=8$ as the initial personal score. Federico must decide which exam he wants to take, being $[5,7,1]$ the marks list. If he takes the first one, being $5 < 8$ and $8 - 5 = 3$, the remaining list now becomes $[10,4]$, and his score is updated as $S = 5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chaotic university where the only real exam seems to be choosing the best way to take exams, you are the poor student advisor who is facing a long queue of confused people who need some help. Federico is next in line,  and he comes up in turn with an inescapable question: he wants to know which is the highest score possible he could get. \n",
    "\n",
    "a) Fortunately, you have a computer app designed by a brilliant student. Federico wants you to show him the code which this app is based on\n",
    "because he wants to do paid counseling for other desperate students: in a *recursive* fashion, the helped helps the helpable.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Federico is getting angry because he claims that your code is slow! Show him formally with a big-O notation that he is as crazy as this university! \n",
    "\n",
    "c) If, unfortunately, Federico is right in the grip of madness, he will threaten you to optimize the code through a different approach. \n",
    "You should end this theater of the absurd by any means! (And again, formally prove that you improved time complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Ask chatGPT for a third (optimized) implementation and analyze again its time complexity. Be careful (and crafty) in defining the prompt, and challenge the machine in this coding question!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some input/output examples (the first value is the initial personal score, and the second line contains the list of marks): \n",
