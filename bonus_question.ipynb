    "[Density-based clustering](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/widm.30) identifies clusters as regions in the data space with high point density that are separated from other clusters by regions of low point density. The data points in the separating regions of low point density are typically considered noise or outliers. Typical algorithms that fall into this category are [OPTICS](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/304181.304187) and [DBSCAN](https://cdn.aaai.org/KDD/1996/KDD96-037.pdf).\n",

    "1)  Ask ChatGPT (or any other LLM tool) to list three algorithms for Density-Based Clustering. Choose one and use it on the same dataset you used in 2.3. Analyze your results: how different are they from the centroid-based version?\n",

    "__Note__: You can implement your algorithm from scratch or use the one implemented in the scikit-learn library; the choice is up to you!\n"
